### Design Pattern

* Bloc is a design pattern to help separate business logic from the presentation layer and enable a developer to reuse code more efficiently.It helps developers implement the Bloc design pattern in their Flutter application. It means that a developer must know the state of an app at any time. There should be something displayed on the screen for every interaction with the app to let users know what is happening.
